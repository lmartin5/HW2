        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>
            &emsp;I am a student at Gonzaga University majoring in computer science and mathematics. 
            I grew up on a wheat and cattle ranch outside of Rufus, OR. Hardwork and commitment 
            are two values very important to me. I am on track to graduate with my BS in computer 
            science in June 2023, and with my BS in mathematics in August 2023. As of right now, 
            I plan to persue graduate studies in math with the ultimate goal of obtaining a PhD. My passion 
            for math developed in my <a href="career#research">research experience</a> at Gonzaga
            and during my REU in the summer of 2022.
            However, I also have interests in working in consulting for software development. I believe
            that my strong mathematical reasoning and programming skills will allow me to be successful 
            beyond my undergraduate studies.
